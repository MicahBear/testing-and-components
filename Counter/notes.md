# Closure

## What is Closure ?

A closure is created when a function is defined inside another function, and the inner function references variables in the outer function's scope. When the inner function is returned from the outer function, it retains a reference to the outer function's scope, and can continue to access those variables even after the outer function has finished executing. 

## When to use Closure concept ?

Closures are useful for creating private variables and functions, implementing partial function application, and preserving state in asynchronous code.
In a programmer languge it's called lexical environment
